## Commission Cut Proposal
This Repository contains a "Commission Cut" proposal submitted for the [Rapid Research Incubator](https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/options-forum-thread/). This repository is a consolidation of the thoughts and files from the DAO Forum post submission [DAO Forum post submission here](https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/rapid-research-incubator-submission-eth-only-minipools-divert-a-portion-of-commissions-to-rpl-staked-minipools/)

### Summary
The summary of this idea is to introduce Eth only minipools, where a portion of their
rewards are diverted to RPL staked minipools.

As a simple example, start by offering new node operators the same product as Lidoâ€™s CSM: (4E bond, and 7.5% commission on the other 28E). For an rETH holder, the commission could remain at 14%, leaving 6.5% on the 28E per minipool to be diverted to RPL staked minipools.
