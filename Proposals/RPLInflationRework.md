## RPL Inflation Rework:

Change RPL Inflation (proposals range from changing distribution eligibility to removing inflation altogether)

### Present Day State:

- Total RPL Inflation is at 5%
- 1.5% out of 5% (30%) goes to funding the pDAO and oDAO (we'll call this "DAO RPL Inflation")
- 3.5% out of 5% (70%) goes to NO's (we'll call this "NO RPL Inflation")
  - Distribution is calculated according to [RPIP30](https://rpips.rocketpool.net/RPIPs/RPIP-30) as described below:
    - If your staked RPL value in ETH is below 10% borrowed ETH, weight is 0
    - From 10%-15% borrowed ETH, weight is linear with the amount of borrowed ETH
      - ðŸ§® `weight = 100 * staked_rpl_value_in_eth`
    - Above 15%, weight follows a logarithmic curve, rising forever, but ever-more-slowly
      - ðŸ§® `weight = (13.6137 + 2 * ln(100 * (staked_rpl_value_in_eth / borrowed_eth) - 13)) * borrowed_eth`
    - The NO share of inflation gets split up to each node as `weight/total_summed_weight`

### Proposals:

#### 1. Change RPL Inflation to NO's to distribute by Borrowed ETH

- Source: Samus' [Cohesive Proposal](https://github.com/orangesamus/RocketPoolRapidResearchIncubator/blob/main/CohesiveProposal.md)
- Summary:
  - Change distribution of "NO RPL Inflation" to scale linearly with Node Operator Borrowed Eth. Rewards would be distributed to all NO's as calculated by `(your Borrowed ETH)/(total Protocol Borrowed ETH)`

#### 2. Scale Down RPL Inflation to NO's over time

  - Valdorff's [Cohesive Proposal](https://github.com/Valdorff/rp-thoughts/blob/2024-02_strategy/2024_02_strategy/readme_tier3.md)
- Summary:
  - Scale down "NO RPL Inflation" from present value (3.5%) to 0% as rETH market share grows from present day to it's soft-limits goal (soft-limit described in [RPIP17: Self-Limiting Rocket Pool](https://rpips.rocketpool.net/RPIPs/RPIP-17)).
  - Leave support for RPL rewards (set setting to zero). Eg, if we wanted to run a short term NO onboarding blitz, it might make sense to add RPL rewards.

#### 3. Remove RPL Inflation to NO's

- Source: Valdorff's [Cohesive Proposal](https://github.com/Valdorff/rp-thoughts/blob/2024-02_strategy/2024_02_strategy/readme_tier3.md)
- Summary:
  - Set "NO RPL Inflation" to 0% ending all RPL rewards to NO's.
  - In this structure, we don't need to use RPL inflation to get more people staking RPL to meet rETH demand. Insofar as folks have unstaked, they're at least doing a service to RPL stakers by giving up their share. If they're doing something like LPing, then they're further serving RP.

#### 4. Remove RPL Inflation to oDAO & pDAO and replace with ETH commission

- Source: Samus' [Cohesive Proposal](https://github.com/orangesamus/RocketPoolRapidResearchIncubator/blob/main/CohesiveProposal.md)
- Summary:
  - Add a commission share for the oDAO (set settings to zero to start).
  - Add a commission share for the pDAO (set settings to zero to start).
  - As rETH TVL grows, the amount of revenue generated from commission becomes large enough that a slice of commission could be used to fund the pDAO and oDAO.
  - During the transition period the pDAO and oDAO could have a blend of funding from both ETH commission and RPL inflation.
